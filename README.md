# Generating noisy labels to combat noisy labels: Imbalanced classification based sample selection

This repository contains the implementation of the paper: **Generating noisy labels to combat noisy labels: Imbalanced classification based sample selection**. 

In this paper, we propose a sample selection method for learning with noisy labels.
